            <h2>The History of Algebra</h2>
            <p>Algebra is a branch of mathematics that studies symbols and the rules for manipulating them. Its origins trace back to ancient civilizations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Babylonians (2000–1600 BCE):</strong> Used algebraic methods to solve quadratic and cubic equations using geometric methods.</li>
                <li><strong>Greeks (circa 300 BCE):</strong> Focused on geometric algebra, representing equations as lengths and areas.</li>
                <li><strong>Persians & Arabs (9th century):</strong> Mathematicians like <strong>Al-Khwarizmi</strong> formalized the symbolic manipulation of equations, giving algebra its name from <em>al-jabr</em>, meaning "reunion of broken parts".</li>
                <li><strong>European Renaissance:</strong> Algebra evolved into symbolic form with the introduction of letters representing unknowns and coefficients.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="concepts">
            <h2>Core Concepts in Algebra</h2>
            <p>At its essence, algebra deals with understanding relationships between quantities. Key concepts include:</p>
            <h3>Variables</h3>
            <p>Symbols (often letters) that represent numbers or quantities. For example, in <code>x + 3 = 7</code>, <code>x</code> is a variable.</p>

            <h3>Expressions</h3>
            <p>Combinations of numbers, variables, and operations. Example: <code>2x + 5y - 7</code>.</p>

            <h3>Equations</h3>
            <p>Statements asserting that two expressions are equal. Example: <code>3x - 2 = 7</code>.</p>

            <h3>Inequalities</h3>
            <p>Relations that express a "greater than" or "less than" comparison. Example: <code>2x + 5 &lt; 11</code>.</p>

            <h3>Functions</h3>
            <p>Rules that assign each input exactly one output. Example: <code>f(x) = 2x + 3</code>.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="types">
            <h2>Types of Algebra</h2>
            <p>Algebra has evolved into multiple subfields, each deepening our understanding of mathematics:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Elementary Algebra:</strong> Basic operations and solving equations.</li>
                <li><strong>Abstract Algebra:</strong> Studies algebraic structures like groups, rings, and fields.</li>
                <li><strong>Linear Algebra:</strong> Focuses on vector spaces and linear transformations.</li>
                <li><strong>Boolean Algebra:</strong> Deals with logic and binary systems.</li>
                <li><strong>Universal Algebra:</strong> Explores general structures and their properties.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="applications">
            <h2>Applications of Algebra</h2>
            <p>Algebra is not just abstract theory—it underpins vast areas of science, technology, and daily life:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Engineering:</strong> Used in circuit analysis, structural design, and control systems.</li>
                <li><strong>Physics:</strong> Models motion, energy, and waves with equations.</li>
                <li><strong>Computer Science:</strong> Fundamental in algorithms, cryptography, and programming logic.</li>
                <li><strong>Economics & Finance:</strong> Models growth, interest rates, and optimization problems.</li>
                <li><strong>Biology:</strong> Used in modeling population growth, genetics, and enzyme reactions.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="advanced">
            <h2>Advanced Topics in Algebra</h2>
            <h3>Group Theory</h3>
            <p>Studies sets with an operation that combines elements to form a new element, obeying rules like associativity and identity. Fundamental in understanding symmetry in mathematics and physics.</p>

            <h3>Ring and Field Theory</h3>
            <p>Explores algebraic structures where addition, subtraction, and multiplication follow specific rules. Fields, for example, form the foundation of number systems used in algebra and calculus.</p>

            <h3>Linear Algebra</h3>
            <p>Focuses on vectors, matrices, and linear transformations. Critical for computer graphics, quantum mechanics, and machine learning.</p>

            <h3>Polynomial Algebra</h3>
            <p>Deals with expressions of the form <code>a_nx^n + ... + a_1x + a_0</code>, crucial for solving equations and modeling curves.</p>

            <h3>Algebraic Geometry</h3>
            <p>Studies solutions of polynomial equations as geometric objects, bridging algebra and geometry in profound ways.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Why Algebra Matters</h2>
            <p>Algebra is the language of mathematics. Its principles underpin not only every branch of math but also logic, computation, and problem-solving across disciplines. By abstracting patterns and relationships, algebra allows humans to model, predict, and innovate with precision and creativity.</p>
            <p>As mathematician <strong>Emmy Noether</strong> famously stated, algebraic structures reveal the symmetry and fundamental laws governing mathematics itself.</p>

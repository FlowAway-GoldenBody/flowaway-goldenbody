The cat performs a rhythmic, light-footed "dance" (perhaps graceful head bobs, tail swishes, or playful paw movements) perfectly synchronized to a high-energy, modern Indian-fusion track that blends traditional instruments with a contemporary beat.\n\nThe set should be lit with dramatic, high-contrast studio lighting, using deep shadows and vibrant, focused light sources (like a single spotlight or color-gelled diya light) to make the outfit and the cat\'s eyes truly pop. The background should be simple yet elegant, featuring blurred bokeh from fairy lights or a stylized rangoli pattern.'},

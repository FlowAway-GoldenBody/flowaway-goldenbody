King","i18n_translation.workout.hint.184":"Good technique is to force your opponent's pieces to the side of the board where they lack room. You should then be able to separate the knight from the king and win it. Remember that it is often better to make a quiet move which limits your opponent's options than to just give a series of checks.","i18n_translation.workout.hint.204":"Be very careful to avoid stalemate. Sometimes you need to let go of some material to make progress.","i18n_translation.workout.hint.205":"Pawns which are one file apart will defend each other if you handle them correctly. If Black threatens to take one of them, ask yourself: \"what can I do to make it impossible for my opponent to take that pawn safely?\" Keep this in mind. Bring your king up to support the pawns, and the win will be quite easy.","i18n_translation.workout.hint.354":"Two rooks can make a checkmate without the help of your king. Control one row with one rook, then take the next row with the other rook. Repeat this process until you reach the end of the board and the opponent's king can no longer escape.","i18n_translation.workout.hint.356":"If your bishops are next to each other, they create a diagonal barrier that an opponent's king cannot get past. You'll need to gradually force the defending king toward a corner to set up a checkmate.","i18n_translation.workout.hint.357":"To coordinate a bishop and knight, you must realize that the knight needs to cover the bishop's weakness. The bishop can never control the dark squares. You need to herd the enemy king into the light-squared corner where the bishop can checkmate him. One important position is: White Ke6, Nd7, Bg6, versus Black Kc6. It looks like Black is escaping, but if you stay calm, you can cut off the escape with 1.Bd3. Then after 1...Kc7 2.Be4, Black is forced back to the edge.","i18n_translation.workout.hint.363":"Use your king and knight to their utmost! Remember, they are slow at getting around the board, but strong in the area you put them. Don't give the opponent chances to steal the game from you by getting a passed pawn. Absolutely don't allow that!","i18n_translation.workout.hint.364":"Here the danger is that you might run out of pawns. Then, the game would be a draw since your king and knight cannot make a checkmate. You must preserve your remaining precious pawns. Maneuver with your king and knight to get close to the opponent's pawns and win them.","i18n_translation.workout.hint.365":"Don't trade too many pawns. With your extra bishop you should be able to win some pawns instead. Keep your king active. Don't let your opponent make passed pawns, that would be counterplay (chances for them to steal the game from you)!","i18n_translation.workout.hint.366":"Don't trade off any pawns as you'll need them to make a queen to checkmate. Try to freeze the pawns so they are locked up and can't be traded. Then use your king and bishop to maneuver to attack your opponent's pawns. You should be able to pick them off one at a time.","i18n_translation.workout.hint.367":"Don't allow your opponent to make a passed pawn that would give them chances to get a new queen. Use your king to defend your weak pawns or attack your opponent's weak pawns. Try to make room for your rook so it can be powerful.","i18n_translation.workout.hint.368":"This one's hard because your opponent has several extra pawns including a strong passed pawn on d5. Your king is better at defending passed pawns than your rook, and your rook is better at attacking pawns than your king. Block with your king and try to get your rook behind the opponent's pawns to begin capturing them.","i18n_translation.workout.hint.369":"Use the mobility of your queen to capture the opponent's pawns. Target the weak ones; don't attack at random. When you have an advantage in pawns, start trying to get a passed pawn to the end of the board. You can also safely use your king. Black does not have enough pieces to checkmate if you pay attention.","i18n_translation.workout.hint.370":"Pawn trades usually help the defender to get a draw so try to win pawns, not trade them. You'll also need to activate your king to win this one.","i18n_translation.workout.hint.371":"Make sure your king is as active as possible. Then try to make a passed pawn. If you can make two, the opponent's king won't be able to stop them.","i18n_translation.workout.hint.372":"To turn your pawn into a queen, your king will have to get control of the squares in front of the pawn that are guarded by the opponent's king. The technique you use here is called \"flanking.\" When Black's king steps aside, you go around past him and get control of the squares you need.","i18n_translation.workout.hint.373":"If you only had your king and passed pawn against the opponent's king, Black could stop you and get a draw. Use the passed a-pawn as a decoy. While Black's king is eating it, your king goes to the buffet on the kingside and eats all of Black's pawns.","i18n_translation.workout.hint.421":"You have a bunch of extra pieces. Your first mission is to eliminate every last black piece. Trades are good for you because you will have more pieces left. Once Black's king is all alone, it's time to practice making a \"mating net.\" Control all the squares around the king while giving check.","i18n_translation.workout.hint.422":"Trade off all Black's pieces, and you will still have extra pieces left. Then your extra pieces will dominate the board.","i18n_translation.workout.hint.423":"Continue to improve your ability to use extra material. You need to be careful as your opponent has a fair number of pieces. As usual, the plan is to eliminate them all with trades.","i18n_translation.workout.hint.424":"You will have to be very careful here as your opponent has a pretty big army. Try to trade off Black's pieces. You don't have room for too many mistakes or bad trades so be careful.","i18n_translation.workout.hint.448":"If your king gets trapped in a corner of the same color as your bishop, you will lose. Stay away from those!","i18n_translation.workout.hint.450":"One important idea is not to leave your rook or bishop undefended. If you do, a double attack could cost you a piece, and then you'll lose. If you can always keep your pieces defended, you should get a draw.","i18n_translation.workout.hint.451":"Try to keep your rook and knight defended so your opponent can't win one of them with a double attack.","i18n_translation.workout.hint.452":"Don't let the pawn become a queen. To stop it, you always need to block Black's king with yours when he tries to step around the pawn.","i18n_translation.workout.hint.453":"If your opponent only had a knight left, he could not checkmate. Therefore, it is good for you, if you can trade your knight for the last pawn. That will prevent them from ever getting a queen.","i18n_translation.workout.hint.454":"Because of the good placement of your king which blocks the pawn, a queen trade would lead to a drawn pawn endgame. It's going to be hard for Black's king to hide from your queen if Black can't block checks with the queen!","i18n_translation.workout.hint.455":"There is one square where your king can block the enemy pawn forever: a1. If you get there, you'll get a draw, despite the opponent's extra pieces.","i18n_translation.workout.hint.456":"Remember. If you have a King on a1, the a-pawn, supported by Black's king and light-squared bishop, can never get past your king. Therefore, you must use your bishop to stop the h-pawn and your king to stop the a-pawn. Sacrifice your bishop if you need to.","i18n_translation.workout.hint.496":"This position is just for you to practice playing pawn endgames. With best play it will be a draw, but explore the possibilities. If your pawns and your king get separated, the enemy king might eat them!","i18n_translation.workout.hint.497":"Try not to allow any weaknesses in your pawn structure. Keep your king near the action and your rook active. The rook should be able to reach a lot of squares and attack the opponent's pawns.","i18n_translation.workout.hint.498":"Rooks are well placed behind passed pawns. Passed pawns are more dangerous the further they are advanced. Kings are well placed near their own passed pawn. Practice this a bunch!","i18n_translation.workout.hint.502":"This is tricky. To win you must use both your king and queen.","i18n_translation.workout.hint.504":"The queen must force the black king in front of the pawn before you can bring your king into the game.","i18n_translation.workout.hint.506":"When you have a lot of extra pieces, you can checkmate most quickly if you use many of them! Don't just focus on your queen. Get your rooks, bishops, and knights out too. There are no pawns blocking their way!","i18n_translation.workout.hint.507":"Drawing this position is much easier than it looks. There are two keys. First, don't let your king and knight become separated. Second, use your knight (protected by the king) to keep the black king at a distance.","i18n_translation.workout.hint.509":"You are a pawn down, but if you can prevent the approach of White's king, the draw is easy. Look to cut the White king off. If White's pawn advances, there will be plenty of opportunities for checks on the back row.","i18n_translation.workout.hint.51":"You can only give mate by forcing the king to the side of the board first. To do so, you will need to use your king and rook together as an attacking force.","i18n_translation.workout.hint.511":"Despite Black's advanced pawn and the possibility of stalemate (Careful!), this is a win. Seek to bring your king up and create mating threats.","i18n_translation.workout.hint.513":"Your king isn't close enough to create mating threats, but you are still winning here. How can you exploit Black's extra stalemate-denying pawn to create a mate with just your queen?","i18n_translation.workout.hint.515":"It sure looks like you are in trouble, doesn't it? Not so! Just remember your stalemate tricks.","i18n_translation.workout.hint.517":"This one is easy if you do it right. The key is not to let Black's king unite with the pawn. Cut it off now!","i18n_translation.workout.hint.519":"You must be precise here. The white king must approach the black pawn as quickly as possible. How?","i18n_translation.workout.hint.52":"Even though the queen is a powerful piece, she cannot give checkmate on her own. The king must help too. Force the king to the side of the board, then give mate. Be careful to avoid stalemate. Do not just give a random series of checks; instead, look for ways to limit the enemy king's movement.","i18n_translation.workout.hint.521":"The draw is possible, but you have to be careful. Support the pawn with your king, but be very, very careful not to trap your king in front of the pawn.","i18n_translation.workout.hint.523":"You need to move your king out of the pawn's path and promote the pawn, but it is not easy to do so. Use the famous \"build a bridge\" technique by first checking the king and then lifting the rook to the fourth rank so that you can cover your king as it emerges from in front of the pawn.","i18n_translation.workout.hint.525":"It's not time to \"build a bridge\" yet, but we will get there soon. Simply approach with your king, drive the black rook away, and escort your pawn up the board.","i18n_translation.workout.hint.529":"Tough, tough, tough, tough! It certainly looks like a draw with Black's king so close to the pawn. The key here is to cut the king off along the RANK. With the king out of play, you can slowly advance your pawn.","i18n_translation.workout.hint.531":"Two pawns down and we expect you to draw? It's going to be ok. Set up a fortress by preparing to sacrifice your bishop if White plays f6+.","i18n_translation.workout.hint.533":"Sigh... Another two-pawn-down draw?? Yup! Keep your cool and shadow White's king so as to maintain the blockade on the dark squares. If you need to, make a pass with your bishop. Nothing bad will happen!","i18n_translation.workout.hint.535":"To complete this workout, you should know how to win with an outside passed pawn. If necessary, don't be afraid to sacrifice your extra pawn to create a distraction so that you can press an advantage elsewhere on the board.","i18n_translation.workout.hint.537":"The key to conversion is this: First, activate the pieces. Second, activate the king. Third, advance your pawns. Don't be hasty. You are clearly winning and need only be patient.","i18n_translation.workout.hint.539":"Remember your keys to conversion. First, activate the pieces. Second, activate the king. Third, advance your pawns. This is a challenging win, but practicing this will give you great confidence when exploiting material advantages.","i18n_translation.workout.hint.541":"Once again, remember the keys to conversion. First, activate the pieces. Second, activate the king. Third, advance your pawns. The bishop is a long-range piece and doesn't need to be near the action to be effective.","i18n_translation.workout.hint.543":"This one is quite difficult. Be sure to use the long range power of your bishop and seek to create zugzwang to make progress. Watch out for the \"wrong colored bishop\" fortress. If you have only the h-pawn left, Black will draw by hiding the king on h8.","i18n_translation.workout.hint.545":"Although the pawns look scary, they are no match for your king and rook. Drive White into zugzwang and pick off the pawns.","i18n_translation.workout.hint.547":"This endgame is not as easy as it looks. Don't advance your pawns recklessly. Activate your king first and infiltrate the square in front of Black's pawn. When it's time to advance your pawns, think carefully about whether to advance one or two squares.","i18n_translation.workout.hint.549":"This isn't going to be easy. Black has a lot of baby queens out there. Use your rooks and your king to their maximum to target weak pawns and pick them off as quickly as possible.","i18n_translation.workout.hint.551":"This position is very difficult, but it will teach you a lot about  the battle between pieces and pawn. Keep your pieces active, create threats to the Black pawns, and, if Black weakens the pawns, attack and win them!","i18n_translation.workout.hint.553":"The win will not be easy here. Keep your pawn structure healthy. Avoid pawn islands and isolated pawns which will quickly be devoured by the bishops. Use your pawns to restrict Black's bishops as they advance confidently up the board.","i18n_translation.workout.hint.555":"Keep your pawns healthy! Don't allow any backward pawns, isolated pawns, or weak squares in your position. If you use your pawns well, Black's knights will be constantly retreating from their advance.","i18n_translation.workout.hint.73":"Your king is so much more active than your opponent's king that you can force your way in and take all the pawns. Try to get to the e5 square first. Then try to get to the pawn on f5! When you've eaten both pawns, it's time for promotions.","i18n_translation.workout.hint.81":"It is usually correct to improve the position of your king as much as possible before pushing your pawn. If you keep your king in front of your pawn and always advance the king further when you get the chance, you should win.","i18n_translation.workout_category.basic_mates":"Basic Mates","i18n_translation.workout_category.classic_middlegames":"Classic Middlegames","i18n_translation.workout_category.converting_endgame":"Converting Material in the Endgame","i18n_translation.workout_category.defending":"Defending Worse Endgames","i18n_translation.workout_category.equal_endgames":"Playing Equal Endgames","i18n_translation.workout_category.material_middle_game":"Converting Material in the Middlegame","i18n_translation.workout_category.weaknesses_strengths":"Weaknesses/Strengths","i18n_translation.workout_difficulty.advanced":"Advanced","i18n_translation.workout_difficulty.beginner":"Beginner","i18n_translation.workout_difficulty.intermediate":"Intermediate","i18n_translation.workout_difficulty_display_in_list.advanced":"Difficulty: <span %spanAttributes%>Advanced</span>","i18n_translation.workout_difficulty_display_in_list.beginner":"Difficulty: <span %spanAttributes%>Beginner</span>","i18n_translation.workout_difficulty_display_in_list.intermediate":"Difficulty: <span %spanAttributes%>Intermediate</span>","i18n_translation.workout_goal.defend":"Defend","i18n_translation.workout_goal.draw":"Draw","i18n_translation.workout_goal.equalize":"Equalize","i18n_translation.workout_goal.material_gain":"Material Gain","i18n_translation.workout_goal.win":"Win","i18n_translation.workout_goal_display_in_list.defend":"Goal: <span %spanAttributes%>DEFEND</span>","i18n_translation.workout_goal_display_in_list.draw":"Goal: <span %spanAttributes%>DRAW</span>","i18n_translation.workout_goal_display_in_list.equalize":"Goal: <span %spanAttributes%>EQUALIZE</span>","i18n_translation.workout_goal_display_in_list.material_gain":"Goal: <span %spanAttributes%>MATERIAL GAIN</span>","i18n_translation.workout_goal_display_in_list.win":"Goal: <span %spanAttributes%>WIN</span>","i18n_translation.x-ray-attack":"X-Ray Attack","i18n_translation.zugzwang":"Zugzwang","i18n_translation.zwischenzug":"Zwischenzug"},"email":{"i18_translation.enterprise_offer.all_enteprise_have_permission_live_classroom":"All Enterprise account users have the permission to use the Live Classroom tool, even if they are basic members.","i18_translation.enterprise_offer.and_much_more":"And much more!","i18_translation.enterprise_offer.create_multiple_groups":"Create Multiple Groups:","i18_translation.enterprise_offer.full_access_live_classroom":"Full Access to the Live Classroom:","i18_translation.enterprise_offer.if_you_are_interested_getting_enterpise_account":"If you are interested in getting your Enterprise Account please <a href=\"%formUrl%\">fill out this form</a> and we will be contacting you soon with the next steps into your Enterprise Account!","i18_translation.enterprise_offer.invite_existing_kids_to_group":"You can invite existing Kids to your Group by using a Registration Key code or you can easily create new Kid accounts.","i18_translation.enterprise_offer.invite_other_adults_to_help":"Invite other adults (like coaches and teachers) to help create Kid accounts and manage Groups, Subgroups or your entire Organization.","i18_translation.enterprise_offer.invite_other_coaches":"Invite Other Coaches:","i18_translation.enterprise_offer.kids_keep_personal_accounts":"Kids Can Keep Personal Accounts:","i18_translation.enterprise_offer.you_can_create_multiple_groups":"You can create multiple groups and subgroups to organize kids.
